                                                  Script for tracking spermatozoa 
Hi, This Our script for tracking spermatozoa developped as part of the iGEM-Montpellier 2018 competition. 
Our script is based on Trackpy V0.3.2 Packag. The package is available for downloading by this link : https://zenodo.org/record/1226458. 
Trackpy is able to track any biological samples because it performs a band pass and threshold to locate any particle.
Also it uses many tools to filter the data by their appearance to eliminate undesirable data that has been track it. 
Our script track the spermatozoa over time and then give us the X and Y positions for each frame, to analyze their trajectory and velocity.
Their are different parameters for the characterization of the tracked object, like its size and its intensity (mass),
that we will use for filtering out spurious features. Following you can find the script and its explanation line by line.
